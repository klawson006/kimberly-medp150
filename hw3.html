  <p>Hallways can represent continuation and a pathway into something that isn't always known, so I chose to capture the 4th floor hallway both for perspective and that sense of continuation. I experimented with color curves, especially the green and blue settings to make the hallway appear as a dingy yellow, yet complimented with hues of purple and blue that act as highlights bouncing off the walls and floor. Depending on how you percieve it, it can make you feel a sense of unease, calm, or anything in between.</p>
