<h1>"Vector Emotive Eye: Bitter Misery"</h1>
<img src="images/emotive.png" alt="emotiveye" width="200px">
<p> For this project, I decided to depict sadness with my emotive eye, specifically a bitter type of sorrow, whether that may be from resentment, rejection, or silently dealing with inner turmoil. Although blue is typically assoicated with feelings of sadness, I thought the complimentary hues of purple and yellow portray sadness in a unique way. The muted and dark purples are used in my work to show the calmer but pronounced parts of sadness, indicated by the drooping eyelids, the eyebags underneath the eye, and the furrowed eyebrow, creating a sense of weariness caused by strong emotion. While yellow is considered a "happy" color in most contexts, it can also be electrifying or highlight certain things in design due to its brightness. Aside from yellow highlights in varying values and saturation within the eye, the yellow background behind the eye is subtly in the shape of a lemon, which I texture with a dotted line pattern to create a cartoonized texture of one, as well as in the iris. Lemons are known for their bright yet sour/bitter taste. The subtle shape of the lemon in the backrgound, yet noticeable highlights and dotted textures suggest that, while sadness is often hidden or struggled against, especially in contexts where a person holds bitter/sour resentment and pain inside of them, it is still noticeable, illustrating the complexity of human emotion.
