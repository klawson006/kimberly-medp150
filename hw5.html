<h1>"Repeating Frutiger Aero Fruit Bubbles"</h1>
<img src="images/emotive.png" alt="emotiveye" width="200px">
<p>In adobe illustrator, I created oranges and strawberries in bubbles and usd them as a repeated element in my promised future photomontage. Frutiger aero used a lot of nature mixed with glossy elements to promote a clean, bright, sustainable future of abundance, so I thought this would be a great addition to add to my photomontage as part of the message behind it.</p>
