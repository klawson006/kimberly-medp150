<h1>Kimberly's Portfolio</h1>
<img src="kimberly.jpeg" alt="Kimberly Lawson" width="200px">
<p>This is my portfolio site for MEDP150, featuring all my creative works throughout the fall semester.</p>
<p> I believe that art in general and the things I create require trial and error in order to make the final piece meaningful. In my works, whether that may be drawing, painting, 3d building, or designing, the struggle behind finding what “works” and what I think completes what I create is a large part of the artistic process for me. I will always not fit the “mold” that everyone else may follow in order to perfect their techniques, but rather shape the mold to tailor to my creative mistakes. My themes do not revolve around clean lineart or neat editing, but throwing ideas at the wall to see what sticks, usually in hues of purple and blue. .</p>
  <p>More often than not, before I even start something, I typically imagine how it will look and the process of it all in my mind. However, the struggle comes from the actual application of my imagination to reality. In the imaginary “world”, it's as if one romanticizes their ideas before they inevitably have to pick apart the impurities in reality. And while that provides difficulty in getting that perfect angle or touch of detail that your mind conjured up, I find that embracing those struggles makes my works more interesting when you can see trial and error within. My art is for the imperfectionists and the mistake-makers, embracing imperfection and making it interesting. Throughout this class, I aim to experiment with what I’m given even if it's difficult, because trial and error is a creative process.</p>
