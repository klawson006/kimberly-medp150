<p>This is one of the exit signs on the 4th floor. Exit signs to me usually are a great focal point because of the brightness and "in your face" text. To enhance that visual interest, I darkened the tonal range and changed the hue to purple, both because I personally love working with purple and also because it gives off an otherwordly or mysterious feel to works of art when used right. In this way, I turned a simple picture of an exit sign into something that more greatly captures the viewers attention, perhaps maybe making them wonder whats beyond the sign.</p>
