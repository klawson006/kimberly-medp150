<h1>Kimberly Lawson's Reflections</h1>

<p>Reading 1: Susan Sontag "In Plato's Cave"</p>
<p>In the chapter “In Plato’s Cave” from On Photography by Susan Sontag, Sontag makes the point that photographs can allure people into a false perception of reality, due to its inability to capture more than just a second within a moment, and the amount of transformation that a photo can undergo to trick those gullible enough to believe it. In my own experience of photography and editing it, as well as viewing both edited and refined as well as raw photos, I agree with one of Sontag’s main arguments that we can be tricked by a fleeting, single moment within a photograph. When editing and refining my photos, as well as coming across other’s photos on social media, this chapter, in a way, solidifies my idea that the aim to be photogenic misconstrues reality, leading some of us to avoid raw, unfiltered experience in pursuit of that “perfect picture”. Even when trying to mirror reality, photographers are still compelled to “perfectly” capture these so-called realistic moments. As Sontag points out with an example of the FSA photographic project, the need for refinement often trumps making a photo as close to reality as it gets. She writes that they “would take dozens of frontal pictures of one of their sharecropper subjects until satisfied that they had gotten just the right
look on film-the precise expression on the subject's face that supported their own notions about poverty, light, dignity, texture, exploitation, and geometry” (3). I can relate this to my current project in this course with photography and one of my first times using a camera. Although I was capturing real life and the essence of it, whether that was signs in the building or the way that light hit the surface of objects, there was always  somewhat a need for the right angle or focus at the back of my mind. In the world of photography, while some may try to deny it, there are standards that people consciously or unconsciously follow in order to capture the desired feel to a photo. Not only are photographs used for perfection, but also a false sense of truth. As Sontag points out, “Photographs furnish evidence. Something we hear about, but doubt, seems proven when we're shown a photograph of it.” (2). She then gives an example of the Paris police, who in 1871 used photographs as a tool to round up communards. In today’s society, the picture of someone convicted of a crime is, quite literally, taken at face value. It's not difficult to automatically assume something is valid when there is a picture of it, which is how photography can trick us. Through photography, I realize that I can ironically represent notions of gullibility of our world, especially in the age of AI where things are slowly becoming less discernable. By editing and changing certain elements, to the untrained eye, a flat visual of a fleeting moment in time can become their truth, especially in a world where perfection is celebrated more than unfiltered reality.</p> 

<p>Reading 2: With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster</p>
<p>The article “With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster” by Nesrine Malik identifies and discusses the surge of what is being referred to as “AI slop” on social media, especially on whatsapp, and the authors own experiences, whether willingly or not, viewing AI generated media. Upon initially reading the title first, I had somewhat of a clear idea of what I was going to read in this article. I am all too familiar with “AI slop”, and how social media sites like instagram, twitter, youtube and whatsapp especially seem like they have been catering to the boom of artificial intelligence in the media; therefore, the author’s personal experience both on their own, and seeing others; especially the elderly consume such content,  resonated with my own. Nowadays, it's hard to remember what life was like on youtube and other media without AI generated content. Before 2020 and 2021, artificial intelligence felt like something that hardly existed at all. I mainly only heard of ideas that robots would take over the world in cheesy movies or science fiction, and I never thought more of it than just imagination. But now, even if there isn’t blood, death, or chaos, artificial intelligence feels as though it's taking over our lives in many different ways. In my day to day life, it's hard to completely avoid AI in the digital media I consume. When I started reading this article, the introduction paragraph where Malik describes some of it as “pornified display of women” (1) did catch me off guard, but also felt relatable as I’ve unfortunately experienced ads on youtube where AI content displayed women in objectifiable ways. I have also witnessed the “right wing political fantasy” (2) genre of this form of content, usually involving trump or biden in ridiculous scenarios. One of many prime examples being what Malik mentions about the white house, and them using AI art to depict a Dominican woman being arrested by ICE (2). And one of the worst parts of it is the fact that the older generations are more gullible in believing such content is real, as AI becomes more realistic every day. Like the elderly woman Malik says believes in the AI videos of Sudan’s war, many like her are less inclined to distinguish between fantasy and reality in the age of artificial intelligence. However, from what I’ve seen, rarely do any large companies try to stop this and one of many answers points as to why. If it's not the corny political AI content, then it's the silly videos on my feed such as “feeding AI fruits” or generated people yelling and “roasting” each other, or maybe even song covers that are made using cartoon character’s voices. Because these videos are seen as generally fun, silly, harmless, and lacking much of value, there is no immediate threat for these companies to try and reduce the amount of AI content on their platforms. And with the push for meta ideas about the future, including the future of AI, this article highlights its worsening impact on the internet landscape, how repeated viewing of this content begins to blur the lines between what is real and fake, and the possible dangers it presents not even just for the older generations, but our society as whole. </p>
