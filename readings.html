<p>Reading 1: Susan Sontag In Plato's Cave</p>
<p>In the chapter “In Plato’s Cave” from On Photography by Susan Sontag, Sontag makes the point that photographs can allure people into a false perception of reality, due to its inability to capture more than just a second within a moment and also the amount of transformation that a photo can undergo and trick those gullible enough to believe it. In my own experience of photography and editing it, as well as viewing both edited and refined as well as raw photos, I agree with one of Sontag’s main arguments that we can be tricked by a fleeting, single moment to be true from photography. When editing and refining my photos, as well as coming across other’s photos on social media, this chapter, in a way, solidifies my idea that the aim to be photogenic misconstrues reality, leading some of us to avoid raw, unfiltered experience in pursuit of that “perfect picture”. 
Even when trying to mirror reality, photographers are still compelled to “perfectly” capture these so-called realistic moments. As Sontag points out with an example of the FSA photographic project, the need for refinement often trumps making a photo as close to reality as it gets. She writes that they “would take dozens of frontal pictures of one of their sharecropper subjects until satisfied that they had gotten just the rightlook on film-the precise expression on the subject's face that supported their own notions about poverty, light, dignity, texture, exploitation, and geometry” (3). I can relate this to my current project in this course with photography and one of my first times using a camera. Although I was capturing real life and the essence of it, whether that was signs in the building or the way that light hit the surface of objects, there was always  somewhat a need for the right angle or focus at the back of my mind. In the world of photography, while some may try to deny it, there are standards that people consciously or unconsciously follow in order to capture the desired feel to a photo. As Sontag points out,</p>
