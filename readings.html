<h1>Kimberly's Reflections</h1>

<p>Reading 1: Susan Sontag In Plato's Cave</p>
<p>In the chapter “In Plato’s Cave” from On Photography by Susan Sontag, Sontag makes the point that photographs can allure people into a false perception of reality, due to its inability to capture more than just a second within a moment, and the amount of transformation that a photo can undergo to trick those gullible enough to believe it. In my own experience of photography and editing it, as well as viewing both edited and refined as well as raw photos, I agree with one of Sontag’s main arguments that we can be tricked by a fleeting, single moment within a photograph. When editing and refining my photos, as well as coming across other’s photos on social media, this chapter, in a way, solidifies my idea that the aim to be photogenic misconstrues reality, leading some of us to avoid raw, unfiltered experience in pursuit of that “perfect picture”. Even when trying to mirror reality, photographers are still compelled to “perfectly” capture these so-called realistic moments. As Sontag points out with an example of the FSA photographic project, the need for refinement often trumps making a photo as close to reality as it gets. She writes that they “would take dozens of frontal pictures of one of their sharecropper subjects until satisfied that they had gotten just the right
look on film-the precise expression on the subject's face that supported their own notions about poverty, light, dignity, texture, exploitation, and geometry” (3). I can relate this to my current project in this course with photography and one of my first times using a camera. Although I was capturing real life and the essence of it, whether that was signs in the building or the way that light hit the surface of objects, there was always  somewhat a need for the right angle or focus at the back of my mind. In the world of photography, while some may try to deny it, there are standards that people consciously or unconsciously follow in order to capture the desired feel to a photo. Not only are photographs used for perfection, but also a false sense of truth. As Sontag points out, “Photographs furnish evidence. Something we hear about, but doubt, seems proven when we're shown a photograph of it.” (2). She then gives an example of the Paris police, who in 1871 used photographs as a tool to round up communards. In today’s society, the picture of someone convicted of a crime is, quite literally, taken at face value. It's not difficult to automatically assume something is valid when there is a picture of it, which is how photography can trick us. Through photography, I realize that I can ironically represent notions of gullibility of our world, especially in the age of AI where things are slowly becoming less discernable. By editing and changing certain elements, to the untrained eye, a flat visual of a fleeting moment in time can become their truth, especially in a world where perfection is celebrated more than unfiltered reality.</p>
