<h1>"The Future We Were Promised"</h1>

For this project, the overall message stems from an early 2000s aesthetic known as frutiger aero. By definition, frutiger aero was a popular web aesthetic that was prominent in the early 2000s and 2010s. It depicted glossy interfaces and predominantly blue and green cholor schemes, mainly due to the focus around nature, especially water and earth. This style choice reflected what people envisoned as the future at the time, a utopia of sustanability and deep connection with nature and technology. However, this soon became a lost idea in the modern age, where companies are now simplifying logos and interfaces for a more clean, sleek look. I chose to blend in a modern building with a more idealized futuristic one to show the contrast between the early romanticized predicitons versus reality. The trashcan and and pile of trash are blended and masked in to represent the contrast between the clean corporate style of modern times versus ongoing problems such as pollution. The text "the future we were promised" ties this all together, a popular saying from those who miss the early colorful flair of the internet, emphasizing how the prospects of a more sustainable and colorful future that frutiger aero depicted was never truly met. 
  <h1>"It Really is that Damn Phone")</h1>

<p>Like my other finished piece, this one also focuses on specific issues of the internet. In mine and other's personal lives, many parents seem to blame phones for negative behaviors of their childrem, especially laziness or depression. While this was once thought of as merely parents finding excuses to blame modern society for their children's problems, I've noticed on social media that, in certain posts with negatuve things revolving around the internet, some people would comment "it really is that damn phone". And in my opinion, there is some truth to that sentiment. Depicted by my masking of the creepy yellow eyes and my use of the red filter with the text messages, I tried to depict how much on;ine bullying and negative information can affect someone. I used the warp tool to make the messages snake out of the phone, as if its coming to harm the user. I also experimented with texture in this one, using a fingerprint texture to represent how much time is spent on our phones, a visual representation of time consumption. Through these methods, I compiled these photos to capture what it can be like in today's society to browse the internet. It makes us think, that perhaps our parents did have a point all along. Maybe it really is "that damn phone". </p>
