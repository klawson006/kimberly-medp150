<p>For this assignment, I chose plants behind blue bars mainly because of the color scheme and my fondness of nature. I wanted to select something that wouldn't be too complex to block out shapes over, so I tried to find something with a few simple plants to focus on. The small plants framed by the blue metal bars in the foregound was intriguing and easy to work with. especially in the way that it contrasts the black background. I mainly used the rectangle shape tool and adjusted its curves to block out the organic shapes of the plants and the bars. Then, I used lighter and darker hues of green to add small details to each of the plants, using my lightest green to add highlights to the metal bars. Finally, although it wasn't present in the original photo, I decided to create pebbles and stones in the background of varying shapes and colors. I used a gradient to give them highlights and depth, then added texture to give the illustration a more organic feel. Overall, my stylistic choices did not merely stick to only what was in the initial image, but expanded on those details to make it more lively and expressive.  </p>
