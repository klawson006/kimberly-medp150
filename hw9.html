 <h1>"Correlation Between Personalitity Type and Pet Preference"</h1>
  <img src="images./data.png" alt="sata" width="200px">
<p>For this project, I first collected data by using a google form. I was always interested in how an individual's pet preference related to their personality type, so I researched the types of personalities, and kept it simple by focusing on 2 common pet choices: dogs and cats. I collected data around the campus from students across my classes. To my surprise, out of the 12 responses on the pet preference question, there was a 50/50 split. This made for a creative idea of mine to make both halves of the pie chart correspond with an illustrated animal. Bar graph wise, I was also surpised that there were a whopping 66.7% of introverts out of the 12 who did my survey. Like the pie chart, I was going to make the bars cat and dog shaped. However, to avoid confusion and balance data with creativity, I settled on a paw print background and warm brown/yellow color scheme. In this way, I feel like I effectively created a data set that, while not entirely perfect, both informs and invites playfulness and interest in research.   </p>
