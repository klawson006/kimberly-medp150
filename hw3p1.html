<h1>Shallow DOF </h1>
<img src="images/shallow.jpg" alt="shallow depth" width="200px">
  <p>Shallow depth of field of a picture of a waterbottle I took in class. I experimented with other objects, but the bottle seemed to pick up the most crisp quality so I stuck with it.</p>
  <h1>Deep DOF</h1>
  <img src="images/depth.jpg" alt="deep depth" width="200px">
<p>Deep depth of field of a picture of the same waterbottle.</p>
 <h1>Photoshopped Field Blur</h1>
  <img src="images/photoshopped.jpg" alt="photoshopped" width="200px">
  <p>Using the photoshop tutorials, I was able to recreate the blurred background in the shallow depth of field photograph I took. Comparing these two photos, I think its easier to tell that this one is photoshopped because there is an uncanny sense of displacement, maybe derived from the unrealistic edges around the borders of the bottle that rival the background blur..</p>
